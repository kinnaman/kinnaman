|Block Name|Quantity|
|:--------:|-------:|
|Barrel    |		 3|
|Oak Trap Door|	 1|
|Stone Brick Wall| 2|
|Spruce Stairs|	 4|
|Oak Fence|	4|
|Birch Sign|	1|
|Carpet|	20|
|Oak Gate|	3|
|String|	12|

This extremely simple design was made for my Minecraft Realm's trading zone. Use string to suspend the carpet when it is not above a fence or sign.
