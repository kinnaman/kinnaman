Setting up Skyrim on Linux is mightily easy. And I cannot advise torrenting the CODEX copy from Pirate Bay if you want to test the game before purchase, even though CODEX has a reputation for quality safe game torrents. 

The only error after set up is tabbing out of game causes a freeze.

1. Download the game, wine, and wine tools.

<code>$ sudo apt install wine winetricks</code>

2. Run <code>winetricks</code> and set up a 64-bit instance on Windows7 with <code>d3dx9_42</code>, <code>xact64</code>, and <code>vcrun2019</code> installed.
3. Installing both the <code>skyrimSE.exe</code> and <code>skyrimSELauncher.exe</code> are required to launch the game. Use <code>ufw</code> in Ubuntu if you run into issues from the DRM trying to connect to the internet in order to block it, as that is the default firewall.
