**Rating: 2/5**

After noticing how popular this book was and being intrigued by the catching title, I read this book to moderate disappointment. *Atom Habits* written by James Clear is undeserving of a full read. Instead the actual substance of the book could be drawn from reading the end chapter summaries and it would save the reader a gross amount of time. The writing was simple and the anecdotes weren't horrible. Further much of the book is riddled with poor pseudo-psychology and lacks compelling arguments or evidence to his assertions when an original thought is presented. I suppose it's for the casual reader that wants a feeling of motivation; but investing more than a half hour into the book would be a waste of time. Books like *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People* and this all hold the same message, most can be skimmed and the summaries do more than enough if the reader is at least a semi-functional adult. Reading a book created by a psychologist or behavioral scientist would be more interesting, as habit formation and addiction are fascinating parts of the human condition.
