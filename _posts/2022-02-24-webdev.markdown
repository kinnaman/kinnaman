Learning to build websites can be learned entirely online for free. Though in person mentoring can be useful, one of the most important skills as a technology skills is learning how to answer your own questions. This is a resource for others to reference if they're curious about web development. It is loosely based off of university code camps syllabi.

I used many of these same resources when I taught myself and friends how to do simple web development. Be sure to use search engines, forums, mentors, and online communities.
