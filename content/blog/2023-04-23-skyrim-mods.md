I play Skyrim Special Edition that's sold on Steam. Using [NexusMods][nexus] and [Vortex][vortex], it is extremely easy to install and use countless free mods created by an immensely talented community. Below are my favorite mods to enhance the vanilla experience without deviating too far. It does raise the system requirements, but virtually any discreet graphics card will run all the mods at a playable framerate.
