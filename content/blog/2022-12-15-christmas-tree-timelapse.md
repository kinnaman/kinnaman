Faith and I spent a few hours decorating our Christmas tree today. During which, I set up my camera on 2 second intervals to take snapshots of us putting it together. With a total of over 4,000 images captured in RAW the timelapse photos took over 90GB of space. I used [Darktable][1] to correct the white balance and exposure slightly, then converted the images to JPEG. Each photo went from 22MB to 500KB, and from there I used [Kdenlive][2] to make a webm video that only took 138MB. It was a fun little project that takes little active time to actually set up, edit, and render.

In the future, I believe using another camera without a shutter would be beneficial as the shutter from the DSLR would be distracting if you wish to take a timelapse of a social event. At least it appears that DSLRs are a thing of the past, and mirrorless cameras are taking their stead.
