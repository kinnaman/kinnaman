Faith and I spent a few hours decorating our Christmas tree today. I also practiced using Darktable and Kdenlive in creating timelapses. With approximately 4,000 images captured in RAW, the total volume of the images were 90GB. I used darktable to correct the white balance and exposure slightly, converting the images to JPEG. Each photo went from 22MB to 500KB, and from there I used Kdenlive to make a webm video that only took 138MB. It was a fun little project to do for recording the memory and I hope to capture more of the holiday and complete a more encompassing holiday timelapse.
