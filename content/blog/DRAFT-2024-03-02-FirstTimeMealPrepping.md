INTRODUCTION
I am reading a book calleed "How to Cook Everything" by Mark Bittman. It is filled with simple recipes, which to me seem daugnting due to my lack of experience. However I have learned to love food over the last few years, now desiring how to make it myself.

Budgeting
I spend way too much on crappy microwaveable food for home and Jimmy John's for lunch.

Future
It is clear there are more good recipes than I realized within the book. For instance, in the sandwich section, spins on the tuna sadwich included the egg salad sandwich. Which means that using the current ingrediants I have, I already have more variations to give a go. I'm excited 

Real Foods:
- Egg salad sandwich pg 804 
- Egg scramble for breakfast (Bechamel sauce pg 79 and 723)
- Homemade sandwich bread pg 790

Sweets
- Microwave flan? Tiktok recipe
- Homemade chocolate chip cookies
