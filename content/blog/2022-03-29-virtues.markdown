Virtue is a habit and like all habits it can be conditioned. Below are the most important virtues for me. It is adopted partially from the 13 virtues of [Benjamin Franklin][13-virtues], [Buddhist virtues][buddism], and the 7 [Christian virtues][2] I was taught as a child. 

#### Personal Virtues
- **Temperance.** Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. 
- **Silence.** Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. 
- **Resolution.** Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. 
- **Frugality.** Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing. 
- **Industry.** Lose no time; be always employed in something useful
- **Sincerity.** Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly. 
- **Moderation.** Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. 
- **Cleanliness.** Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or habitation. 
- **Equanimity.** Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. Learn to accept both loss and gain with calm.
- **Fortitude.** Have courage in adversity. Discourage not due to difficulty, fear, or pain. 
- **Kindness.** Think and act with empathy towards others.
