# Depricated instruction! Just use Proton from Steam!!!

Setting up Skyrim on Linux is mightily easy 

The only error after set up is tabbing out of game causes a freeze.

1. Download the game, wine, and wine tools.

<code>$ sudo apt install wine winetricks</code>

2. Run <code>winetricks</code> and set up a 64-bit instance on Windows7 with <code>d3dx9_42</code>, <code>xact64</code>, and <code>vcrun2019</code> installed.
3. Installing both the <code>skyrimSE.exe</code> and <code>skyrimSELauncher.exe</code> are required to launch the game. Use <code>ufw</code> in Ubuntu if you run into issues from the DRM trying to connect to the internet in order to block it, as that is the default firewall in many distros. 

It really is that simple.
