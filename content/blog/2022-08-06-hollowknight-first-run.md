I successfully completed the *Speedrunner 2* achievement for Hollow Knight. To gain the achievement the game has to be beaten under 5 hours. At 3 hours and 40 minutes I succeeded, but it is very slow for a speedrun - filled with mistakes and cheese strategies. For now, I am happy with what I've accomplished but part of me wants to practice until I can run it without dying accidentally.

It should be noted that this run was played on the current patch with the debug mod installed. Although the mod is installed I did not use it for this run and did not remove it as this wouldn't ever be submitted.

Some of the useful resources I looked at were [Emray's guide][1] and the [Hollow Knight Wiki][2].
