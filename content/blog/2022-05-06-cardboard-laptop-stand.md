At work there is a gross excess of cardboard laying around and taking up a large amount of space. To kill two birds with one stone I created a simple cardboard laptop stand that only creates minutes to build. Be sure to print out the stencil then use it to trace onto the cardboard. Afterwords, cut the pieces and assemble together to hold your laptop. Took minutes, looks better than a ream of paper, and didn't cost a dime.
