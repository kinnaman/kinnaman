My friends and I have been playing Minecraft together over the past two weeks. Smoke from the fires in Canada have prevented us from enjoying the outdoors, so the traditionally winter game for us as a group has now occupied a portion of the summer. I conjoined the old world save we had with [MCA Selector][1] and hosted it on my old desktop PC for the first week. Unfortunately our attempts at fighting the Wither kept failing as the server would lag too much for us to shoot projectiles at it in its first phase. Thankfully Maclin has a robust home server we migrated the world files to, so now it runs smoothly even with redstone in spawn chunks and wither fights going on. We also now have plugins on the server to view the generated chunks like as if it were Google maps via [Dynamap][2]. The server uses [Pterodactyle][3] for its control interface, and it works great.
