This is the personal website of Morgan Kinnaman, an IT professional and developer who loves to learn and build. 

This website is to showcase my professional services, open source contributions, designs, thoughts, and more. Everything I post in here is free for use through GPL-3.0 or Create Commons licensing, and I try to provide thorough documentation. 

Although I am enthusiastic about technology and the internet, a healthy balance is needed with nature and real-world engagement. I advocate for greater technology proficiency and science education, as it cultivates better minds for democracy and empiricism.

I spend my time studying, going outdoors, and creating open source projects. I enjoy boating, fishing, motorcycling, reading, chess, and more. It is a beautiful world filled with interesting unique people, and I am grateful for each day in it.

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
