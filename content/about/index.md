This is the personal website of Morgan Kinnaman, an IT professional and developer who loves to learn and build. 

I am enthusiastic about technology and the internet, balanced with a healthy real-world engagement. 

I spend my time studying, going outdoors, and creating open source projects. I enjoy boating, fishing, motorcycling, reading, chess, and more. It is a beautiful world filled with interesting unique people, and I am grateful for each day in it.
