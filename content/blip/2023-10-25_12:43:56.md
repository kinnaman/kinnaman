Today I'm trying to set up my server on an ARM single board computer. I have an H616 based android TV box that I want to repurpose for email and web hosting. I'm flashing a micro-SD card at a coffee shop so it'll be awhile before I can troubleshoot any potential hiccups that it ran into. There are several repositories I've found for Armbian, but the one [labled as H616][1] is well worth a try.

While that git repository slowly downloads on the coffeeshop wifi I'm editing my Neovim config. I will probably add plugins from [this article][2] later but I'm mostly removing plugins for now.

I downloaded the repository is a bit more irksome to use than I expected as I have to edit the config and compile the repostiory. I am trying the compilation and use once while the [image from the website][3] is downloading in the background, but I'm not holding out hope.
