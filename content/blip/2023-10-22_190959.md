After trying the Quest 3 at Bestbuy, I was set on purchasing a Quest for home gaming and to tinker with. So yesterday I purchased the Quest 2, as I do not have a great desire for the XR features yet and it would be ~$200 less to purchase. I was wrong to choose the older model, as I quickly felt nausea while using the Quest 2. I'm going to return the Quest 2 and spend the extra for the Quest 3.
