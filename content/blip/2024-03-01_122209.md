I fixed a bug I was running into on my own system with regard to my "blip.sh" script. This taught me to test my inputs before executing a script without making assumptions about the system. Still, my blog post files didn't work on windows because they had the incorrect naming schema. Apparently, Windows doesn't allow colons in the name. So I used <code>tr</code> which translates or deletes characters to loop through the file names and remove all the colons.
