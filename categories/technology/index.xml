      <description>Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s developer and user friendly toolkit quickly streamlines building quality static blogs and websites. However, including Javascript sourced from node_modules can cause issues if you are hosting on a site like Github Pages. Resolving the complications is relatively straight forward. Not only will the github repository stay lean, but the code will work in safe mode as well.
The JavaScript from node_modules will be slimmed and output into the source directory with any loaded dependencies.</description>

      <description>Building websites can be learned online for free. Though in person mentoring can be useful, one of the most important skills in IT is the ability to answer your own questions. This is a resource for others to reference if they&amp;rsquo;re curious about web development. It is loosely based off of university code camps syllabi.
I used many of these same resources when I taught myself and friends how to do simple web development.</description>
