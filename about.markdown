This is the personal blog of Morgan Kinnaman. I am an IT professional that freelances in a variaty of trades. I grew up in The Western United States. I enjoy boating, fishing, motorcycling, reading, chess, and more. I believe the only possible future for civilization is through universal world class education and democracy.
