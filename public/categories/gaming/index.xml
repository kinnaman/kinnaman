      <description>My friends and I have been playing Minecraft together over the past two weeks. Smoke from the fires in Canada have prevented us from enjoying the outdoors, so the traditionally winter game for us as a group has now occupied a portion of the summer. I conjoined the old world save we had with MCA Selector and hosted it on my old desktop PC for the first week. Unfortunately our attempts at fighting the Wither kept failing as the server would lag too much for us to shoot projectiles at it in its first phase.</description>

      <description>I play Skyrim Special Edition that&amp;rsquo;s sold on Steam. Using NexusMods and Vortex, it is extremely easy to install and use countless free mods created by an immensely talented community. Below are my favorite mods to enhance the vanilla experience without deviating too far. It does raise the system requirements, but virtually any discreet graphics card will run all the mods at a playable framerate.
Mod List Skyrim 202X 9.0 Address Library for SKSE Plugins - All in one (special edition) Alternate Start - Live Another Life Enhanced Lights and FX Forces New Idles in Skyrim SE - FNIS SE - FNIS Behavior SE 7_6 FranklyHD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons Immersive Amors 8.</description>

This extremely simple design was made for my Minecraft Realm&amp;rsquo;s trading zone. Use string to suspend the carpet when it is not above a fence or sign. Unfortunately I am unable to provide a build guide step by step right now, but I will add it in some later post.
