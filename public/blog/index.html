				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-12-15-christmas-tree-timelapse/" style="text-decoration:none">Christmas Tree Decorating</a></h4>
				Faith and I spent a few hours decorating our Christmas tree today. During which, I set up my camera on 2 second intervals to take snapshots of us putting it together. With a total of over 4,000 images captured in RAW the timelapse photos took over 90GB of space. I used Darktable to correct the white balance and exposure slightly, then converted the images to JPEG. Each photo went from 22MB to 500KB, and from there I used Kdenlive to make a webm video that only took 138MB.

				I successfully completed the Speedrunner 2 achievement for Hollow Knight. To gain the achievement the game has to be beaten under 5 hours. At 3 hours and 40 minutes I succeeded, but it is very slow for a speedrun - filled with mistakes and cheese strategies. For now, I am happy with what I&rsquo;ve accomplished but part of me wants to practice until I can run it without dying accidentally.

				I am the designated industrialist in my Minecraft realm. I enjoy the logistical and technical challenges in automating resource gathering, leaving most of the artistic building up to my friends. These are the mods I use in order to get the most done with the least amount of my time invested actively managing my world.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-05-06-cardboard-laptop-stand/" style="text-decoration:none">Cardboard Laptop Stand</a></h4>
				At work there is a gross excess of cardboard laying around and taking up a large amount of space. To kill two birds with one stone I created a simple cardboard laptop stand that only creates minutes to build. Be sure to print out the stencil then use it to trace onto the cardboard. Afterwords, cut the pieces and assemble together to hold your laptop. Took minutes, looks better than a ream of paper, and didn&rsquo;t cost a dime.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-04-30-war-of-the-worlds/" style="text-decoration:none">War Of The Worlds - Book Review</a></h4>
				Rating - 5/5 || Warning: Spoilers War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is a sci-fi horror classic. It&rsquo;s a story of a Martian invasion narrated by an unnamed 19th century man in England. My first reading of this book was when I was a child in 2005. I scarce remembered it other than it was far different than the movie adaptation starring Tom Cruise.
The original book is far more interesting than the movie, having better characters, stronger themes, and the focus of the story on the protagonist&rsquo;s desire to find his wife out of love instead of desire to get rid of his kids.

This extremely simple design was made for my Minecraft Realm&rsquo;s trading zone. Use string to suspend the carpet when it is not above a fence or sign. Unfortunately I am unable to provide a build guide step by step right now, but I will add it in some later post.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-04-07-atomichabits/" style="text-decoration:none">Atomic Habits - Review</a></h4>
				Rating - 2/5 After noticing the popularity and catchy title, I picked up Atom Habits written by James Clear. To put it briefly, it was a moderate disappointment. The book is undeserving of a full read for most people, which is better than I can say about most self-help books since they give harmful advice. The actual substance of the book could be drawn from reading the end chapter summaries and it would save the reader a gross amount of time.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-03-29-something-wicked/" style="text-decoration:none">Something Wicked This Way Comes - Book Review</a></h4>
				Rating: 3 out of 5 After a decade since I last read this book and twice the age, my experience with this story has changed. Originally when I read it as a boy, the story felt more magical and eerie. I was more focused on the carnival and its mysteries than the characters and their personal growth. I hadn&rsquo;t given thought about how Bradbury&rsquo;s perspective of the world, which hasn&rsquo;t aged well over the decades, is insensitive to people dissimilar to him.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-03-29-virtues/" style="text-decoration:none">Virtue</a></h4>
				Virtue is a habit and like all habits it can be conditioned. Below are the most important virtues for me. It is adopted partially from the 13 virtues of Benjamin Franklin, Buddhist virtues, and the 7 Christian virtues I was taught as a child.
Personal Virtues Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.

				<h4><a href="http://kinnaman.net/blog/2022-03-17-githubpages/" style="text-decoration:none">Sane Jekyll &amp; NPM Setup</a></h4>
				Jekyll&rsquo;s developer and user friendly toolkit quickly streamlines building quality static blogs and websites. However, including Javascript sourced from node_modules can cause issues if you are hosting on a site like Github Pages. Resolving the complications is relatively straight forward. Not only will the github repository stay lean, but the code will work in safe mode as well.
The JavaScript from node_modules will be slimmed and output into the source directory with any loaded dependencies.
