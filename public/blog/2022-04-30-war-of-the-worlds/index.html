Wells is a sci-fi horror classic. It&rsquo;s a story of a Martian invasion narrated by an unnamed 19th century man in England. My first reading of this book was when I was a child in 2005. I scarce remembered it other than it was far different than the movie adaptation starring Tom Cruise.</p><p>The original book is far more interesting than the movie, having better characters, stronger themes, and the focus of the story on the protagonist&rsquo;s desire to find his wife out of love instead of desire to get rid of his kids. Man-childs may be relatable to many, but they are worthy of scorn and detract from an otherwise great premise.</p><p>The narrator in the book was an unremarkable but scholarly man. He possessed an authentic love for his wife and concern for others. Such an apocalyptic scenario was better explored by someone who is both empathetic than someone who never contemplates the consequences of first contact.</p><p>The Martian tripod spaceships are described in such a manner that still give unease to the modern reader. The actions of the narrator and the response from society at that time are both believable and valiant. Humanity gives a honorable fight back despite the certain death that many of the soldiers faced. I remember once hearing that H.G. Wells based the bravery on people&rsquo;s fights against imperialism on the indigenous peoples against American expansionism.</p><p>Although the ending of the Martian invasion by infection was a deus ex machina, I genuinely believe it was a satisfying conclusion to the story. To this day, the modern reader would never believe an alien life form that reaches us first would consider mankind a legitimate threat in traditional combat. However, as a whole Wells argues that life may still prevail. Life is both extremely dangerous and adaptive in this world, and for billions of years it has faced threats of extinction innumerable times. I more readily believe as a reader that disease and viruses are better capable of combating aliens than we could if we were in such a situation.</p><p>Overall Wells explored cosmic horror and the strength of civilization in a humanist and optimistic manner. His rejection of social Darwinism, imperialism, and religion were ahead of his time. It is highly recommended reading even for those who aren&rsquo;t even interested in science fiction.</p></div></div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0-beta1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js integrity=sha384-pprn3073KE6tl6bjs2QrFaJGz5/SUsLqktiwsUTF55Jfv3qYSDhgCecCxMW52nD2 crossorigin=anonymous></script><footer class="text-center text-lg-start bg-light text-muted"><section><div class="container text-center text-md-start mt-5"><div class="row mt-3"><div class="col-md-3 col-lg-4 col-xl-3 mx-auto mb-4"><h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4"></h6><p style=text-align:left>Personal website of Morgan Kinnaman.</p></div><div class="col-md-2 col-lg-2 col-xl-2 mx-auto mb-4"></div><div class="col-md-3 col-lg-2 col-xl-2 mx-auto mb-4"><h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">Social Media</h6><p><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@morgan_kinnaman>Youtube</a></p><p><a href=https://github.com/kinnaman>Github</a></p><p><a href=https://instagram.com/kinnaman>Instagram</a></p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-lg-3 col-xl-3 mx-auto mb-md-0 mb-4"><h6 class="text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">Contact</h6><p><a href=mailto:%20morgan@kinnaman.net>morgan@kinnaman.net</p></a><p></p><p></p></div></div></div></section></footer></body></html>
